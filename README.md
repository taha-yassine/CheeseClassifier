# Cheese Classifier

A cheese classifier based on a CNN with a ResNet34 architecture pretrained on ImageNet. The classifier was trained on images extracted from *Google Image* (cf. *classifier/data/* for full list). I used the *[fastai library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai)* for building the classifier (Notebook available [here](https://github.com/taha-yassine/CheeseClassifier/blob/master/classifier/CheeseClassifier.ipynb)) and *[Django](https://github.com/django/django)* for building the demo app.
